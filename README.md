# CornerGrocer_README
This project is a C++ application designed for the Corner Grocer to analyze item purchase frequencies from text records, aiding in inventory management and store layout optimization. It processes an input file, calculates item frequencies, and outputs results in three formats: a frequency list, a histogram, and a backup file for long-term retention. The use of modular programming principles and efficient data structures, such as maps, ensured robust performance and readability.

Key accomplishments include implementing the ItemTracker class, which encapsulates logic for frequency calculations and data persistence. While the program is functional, enhancements like additional input validation and exception handling could improve security and usability. Challenges, such as formatting the histogram for readability, were addressed through iteration and consultation of C++ resources. This project refined skills in modular programming, file handling, and data structures, which are transferable to larger-scale applications and future coursework.
